/**
  * Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange. Filters come in two forms: symbol filters and exchange filters.
  *
  * The PRICE_FILTER defines the price rules for a symbol.
  *
  * The LOT_SIZE filter defines the quantity (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol.
  *
  * The MIN_NOTIONAL filter defines the minimum notional value allowed for an order on a symbol. An order's notional value is the price * quantity.
  *
  * The MAX_NUM_ORDERS filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol. Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.
  *
  * The MAX_ALGO_ORDERS filter defines the maximum number of "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol. "Algo" orders are STOP_LOSS, STOP_LOSS_LIMIT, TAKE_PROFIT, and TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT orders.
